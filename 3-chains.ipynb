After World War I, the British took control of Palestine and promised both Jews and Arabs self-determination. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, but this plan was rejected by the Arab states, leading to a war between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Since then, there have been numerous conflicts and negotiations, with both sides claiming the right to the land and sovereignty over Jerusalem. The conflict remains unresolved to this day.'"
